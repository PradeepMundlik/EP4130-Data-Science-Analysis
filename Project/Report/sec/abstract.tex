    This research investigates the application of Bayesian methods for probabilistic inference, specifically employing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for data analysis. Bayesian approaches offer several advantages such as incorporation of prior knowledge, explicit uncertainty management, and the ease of assimilating new information, which is particularly useful in high-dimensional statistical models. Our study leverages MCMC to infer the parameters of interest in vehicular stopping distances by constructing a linear model to represent the relationship between a vehicle's speed and its stopping distance. We undertake a rigorous computational approach to address the challenges posed by numerical integration in high-dimensional spaces, presenting an effective strategy for sampling from complex posterior distributions.
